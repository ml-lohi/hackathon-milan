# Project Submission

## How to score?
Check the [challenge introduction](../challenge_introduction.pdf) document for details.

## What needs to be included in the submission?

### Pitch
Your live pitch at the closing ceremony.

### Code
Your code in a *reconstructible* way, meaning we want to verify that your code is running and your results are reproducible. Please provide a step-by-step guide how to get your code running (including dependencies, software versions, etc.). You can also include that in the Application Note (see below).

### Documentation
As in every professional project you have to document your results so others can understand what you did and how they can reproduce it. At Infineon we use Application Notes for that. In this folder you can find the template which you should use as basis for your Application Note (`Infineon-AppNote-Template.xxx`).

### Feedback (Bonus)
Please provide feedback for us. What did you like about the challenge? What should be improved? What would you do differently next time? This is optional, but can get you up to 10 bonus points.

## How to submit?
You can either copy this folder and create a GitHub repository out of it or you just fork our repository directly and add your submission in the submission folder. At the end we need to have a link to your submission repository on GitHub. Please send this link together with your team number to [tbd](mailto:tbd).

## When to submit?
Submission needs to happen before Thursday, 18:00 CET. Submissions after this time cannot be counted.

## What else?
Please give our Radar sensors, tripods and USB cables back before leaving the location on Thursday.
